    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Nicholas.
\n\nI love feesh.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating feesh, too. Raw feesh. Grilled feesh. Smoked feesh. Poached feesh - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go feesh.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about feesh, though.\n\n</string>
